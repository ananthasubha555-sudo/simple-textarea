✍️ Textarea with Real-Time Character Counter

This project is a simple and interactive textarea application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
It allows users to type messages inside a text area and shows a live character count that updates in real time as they type.

🚀 Features

🧮 Real-time character counter

🔢 Displays total and remaining characters

⚠️ Shows a warning when the limit is reached

💻 Clean and responsive design

🎨 Styled using Tailwind CSS for a modern look

🧰 Technologies Used

HTML – To structure the text area and counter display

Tailwind CSS – For styling and layout

JavaScript – To handle real-time character counting

💡 How It Works

The user types a message inside the textarea.

JavaScript listens for the input event and updates the count immediately.

The interface shows how many characters have been typed and how many remain.

When the user reaches the maximum limit (e.g., 200 characters), further typing is restricted or a warning is shown.
